models:
  - name: raw_patients
    description: This model brings in source_a/fhir_patient table from Snowflake exactly the way it is.
    columns:
      - name: id
        description: This is the Medical Record Number, a potential primary key for this table. However, unique test failed so row deduplication needs to be done later on.
        tests: 
        - unique
        - not_null
      - name: identifier
        description: Another column that could be a primary key. But unlike 'id' column (which is a string data type), 'identifier' is of variant data type. In addition to
                    medical record number, there are other PIIs such as SSN and Driver's license number.
        tests:
        - unique
        - not_null
