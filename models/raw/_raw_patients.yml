models:
  - name: raw_patients
    description: This model brings in source_a/fhir_patient table from Snowflake exactly the way it is.
    columns:
      - name: id
        description: This is the Medical Record Number, a potential primary key for this table. However, unique test failed. Upon inspection within, it is found that some rows are
                     duplicates so row deduplication needs to be done.
        tests: 
        - unique
        - not_null
      - name: identifier
        description: Another column that could be a primary key. But unlike 'id' column (which is a string data type), 'identifier' is of variant data type. In addition to
                    medical record number, there are other PIIs such as SSN and Driver's license number. Unique test failed for this column as well.
        tests:
        - unique
        - not_null
